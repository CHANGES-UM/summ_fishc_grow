4014,2834869,Team + Zooniverse Private Board,"Hello @jmschell 

I’ve set up this private Talk board to host our conversations -- it will serve as an easy-to-access record of your project’s status as it moves from beta to full launch that both your team and the Zooniverse team can see and contribute to.

Please see the feedback form available here: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mEafslWTkKaKsALvkiT2clXj0-G7p9gw_tGPC45U54/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to respond to the feedback and questions directly in the doc or in this discussion thread, and be sure to mention me (@blicksam) in your Talk post to send me a notification of your message. And please be sure to post here when you're done responding to feedback and ready for the next step. You can also get in touch by emailing contact@zooniverse.org, but I would prefer using Talk rather than email if possible.

Once you've addressed this initial feedback, we'll get you scheduled for a beta test with our volunteers. Please let me know if you have any questions!

4014,2842475,Team + Zooniverse Private Board,"Hi @blicksam! We just went over all the feedback from Brooke and have responded in the far-right column. We'll get to work on some of the smaller things soon, but I wanted to check on something with you. 

The tutorial is truly fixed width, correct? As I wrote in the response column, given the size/shape of our cards, it's hard to do much with them in the tutorial, especially since the information is sometimes spread out over different parts of the card (and sometimes front/back). I'm pretty sure the answer is ""yes, it is indeed fixed,"" which means we'll be putting more image examples and such into the Help Text field (and pointing that out in the Tutorial and Task instructions). 

Also, we're eventually going to have additional workflows for different kinds of cards (there are ~20 kinds of cards in the overall collection), but these are the types of cards/information that were the highest priority according to the researchers. If you'd rather us not launch all these workflows at once, or have text saying so, we can definitely do that. 

Thanks!

4014,2906215,Team + Zooniverse Private Board,"Hey @jmschell 

Thanks for your patience as we work through our pre-holiday project review backlog. 

To answer your question, yes unfortunately the tutorial is fixed width. But I've passed your feedback along to Becky so it's on her mind for future design updates.

The question of 5 active workflows isn't about whether you should have that many for the full project launch -- you can launch with as many workflows as you like! -- but instead trying to figure out what's the optimal number for the beta test. As you well know, beta tests are about finding the right amount of subjects so that you have enough data to have the beta be active for a full week, but not so much that things don't retire. Since it sounds like all 5 are necessary according to the research team, you might want to consider adding a question to the beta feedback form asking which workflows the beta reviewer tested, to keep the feedback clear. You won't necessarily know whether someone tried 1, or a few, or all of them, so as we're setting up the beta we can add a tickbox question for reviewers to indicate which workflows they tried. 

There are a few places in the doc where you mention things are forthcoming (mostly around adding images/examples) -- are you planning to make these changes before the beta, or would you prefer to move ahead with the beta and implement these changes along with the beta feedback? Once that's clear we can get something on the calendar and move forward with the review process.

Cheers,
Sam",1742464,1550104,Internal Project Review,,For communication between the Zooniverse and research team members,,blicksam,2021-01-15T17:27:03.794Z
4014,2911296,Team + Zooniverse Private Board,"Thanks @blicksam! 

Totally fine that the tutorial is fixed-width, we'll just need to adapt some of the things we have in the tutorial into help text. Could I get your guidance/opinion on the tutorials? I couldn't tell if Brooke was suggesting something that couldn't be done in the tutorial with the images since it's fixed width. I've already made some changes to them to reduce the text, but can you let me know if more should be done? Or if we should put it in beta and see what the volunteer testers think? 

I think that's a good idea to add that option on the Google Form. It brings up a larger question, which is that more workflows will be added as we process more kinds of cards. There's about 20 different kinds of cards, total, but I think that most of the workflows for them will be similar in character to the ones we have now. So, multiple choice,  text transcription, combo tasks, and maybe a dropdown task here and there, but we might only need that for dates, which should all be taken care of by the Basic Information Workflow. So, we could maybe start with three: Basic Information Workflow, Summary Card - Fish Choices, and Fish Growth Analysis - Bluegill, and the other workflows (ones that are ready now and ones that will be ready in the next few months) will have similar tasks. 

The images/text that were marked as forthcoming have been taken care of. 

If it's easier to talk through this via a call, happy to do that!

Thanks as always,

4014,2911438,Team + Zooniverse Private Board,"After going through the Summary Card - Text Fields workflow again (and looking at a sample of the different card types) we're going to need the date information in order to know which ones to put in that workflow. Not all of those fields are listed on all of the cards until after a certain date. So, we can take out the ""Summary Card - Text Fields"" workflow from the beta, because I think it's going to require too much explanation of why certain fields may not be there.  I hope that's clear!

4026,3025278,Overall project questions and feedback,"These Feedback Forms provide *far* too little room for comments. I submitted one but here is more that there was no/inadequate room to include there.

My feedback is based on the general project information and the Text Fields workflow. I reviewed the Fish Growth workflow only briefly, as transcribing lists of repetitive data is a task that does not appeal to me, so that bias prevents me from assessing that workflow fairly. (Two additional workflows appear on the project's statistics page but are not available choices on the project page, so I was not able to review them. They are Basic Information Workflow - Start Here and Summary Card - Fish Choices.)

**Are the project goals clear?**
and
**Did you read the additional information on other pages?** and **If 'yes', was the additional information useful?**

Yes and yes. The About pages are very well done. (I know everyone *should* be able to find it, but on the About/FAQ page, you might make ""Ask us in the Talk section"" a link.)

**Does the tutorial adequately prepare you to make a classification?**

Yes, but... (see next paragraph *and* next item here). The tutorials are clear and thorough.

Please clarify in the tutorial for the Text Fields workflow that ONLY the specified sections of the card are being transcribed, which is a subset of the information present. In addition to omitting several identified areas on both sides of the card, there is other unidentified info typed or written at the top and bottom margins of at least some of the cards, which some classifiers may wonder whether to transcribe as ""remarks"".
Examples:
- image 1 top and bottom, image 2 bottom: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jmschell/angling-for-data-on-michigan-fishes/talk/subjects/52909261
- image 1 top: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jmschell/angling-for-data-on-michigan-fishes/talk/subjects/52909214
- image 1 bottom, image 2 bottom right: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jmschell/angling-for-data-on-michigan-fishes/talk/subjects/52909203


**Does the question/instruction for the task make sense?**
and
**Did you find the task help text useful?**

There is no field help at all!  The tutorials are good but please add field help (at least one per question panel): it's a pain to page through the tutorial to find the info for the field you are working on).

[I don't know why these are separate questions on the form, and not even consecutive. If you are trying to ask about different things in these two questions, I've missed the point.]

**Was the field guide helpful?**

I answered ""no"" because while it appears to provide useful context, it's not helpful *yet*. As a newcomer to the project, it's difficult to tell how much value it has. I would probably care more, and would be able to judge its helpfulness better, after working on the project a while

**Are there suitable Talk boards set up?**

No... at least add one for ""Chat"" (or similar name) so there is somewhere for volunteers to interact with each other, that doesn't feel like it is intended to call on the project team for a response (which ""Overall project feedback"" does).

Angling for Data on Michigan Fishes

This new project from the University of Michigan and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources asks volunteers to help transcribe more than a century's worth of fish observation records, captured on a variety of paper cards, from lakes throughout Michigan. 

Volunteer contributions to the project will allow researchers and resource managers to better understand how factors such as development, invasive species, deforestation, and climate change have affected fish populations over the last hundred years. In addition, we'll utilize the latest in data science to combine data on fish, habitat characteristics and management approaches from a variety of historical surveys in new ways, allowing us to build models that explain how and why fish populations have changed over recent decades, predict what changes are likely to occur in the future, and test which management strategies will improve the resilience of fish populations.

4026,3096213,Overall project questions and feedback,"Hi everybody, 

I came across two cards which had fish reported in said section, but the list of species was not subdivided into Game, Forage, Coarse, and/or Obnoxious categories. 
How to deal with this case? (I'm really sorry that I did not use the Talk option for the specific cards, they popped up in the very beginning of my participation :( )

I was wondering if the info is only valuable for the project if it is clearly specified to which category the fish belong, or if this is just a case that was not considered for the evaluation process yet?
Maybe it would make sense to add a third button (apart from ""Yes"" and ""No"") for answering the first question ""Does this card contain fish species in the Game, Forage, Coarse, and/or Obnoxious categories?"" saying something like ""No - but there is a list of species given"", leading to a form to fill in the unsorted species.

Warm greetings from Upper Austria,
Christine

4026,3096998,Overall project questions and feedback,"Hi! I can try to address both here. 

For the ones that just have a list of fishes that aren't categorized, some people have been selecting them in the categories as they become more familiar with the project. However, it's probably easiest just to choose ""No"" on the first question and go on to another subject. We'll review those later and most likely develop an alternate workflow to capture those. 

The second question has a less straightforward answer, unfortunately. We chose to structure this part of the project around the categories because we thought it would be easier  for volunteers to make use of the ""multiple choice"" feature, rather than having to type everything in, and that having four separate lists of options vs. one long list would also be easier for our volunteers. However, in the long term, the categories aren't crucial to the data. So, the choice is yours: you can either type them in the free text field beneath the list of choices or, if you know for sure that they are part of a different category, you can select them as part of that multiple choice list. 

Regardless of which option you choose, all of the classifications will be aggregated by the research team, so if there is disagreement between classifications of a single subject, we'll look at it and make a determination. 

Thanks for all of your help and let us know if you have any other questions!",1902200,1484814,"@""Summary card - Fish choices"": What if there are species given, but not divided into Game, Forage, Coarse, and/or Obnoxious categories?",,"Share any overall questions or feedback you have on ""Angling for Data on Michigan Fishes""",,jmschell,2021-03-17T16:14:14.184Z

We would love to be able to do that, too. We tested that at an earlier stage of the project because we know it can be difficult to keep your place on the card. However, the aggregation package that Zooniverse created for the drawing tasks (where you draw a box, circle, etc) doesn't work very well with smaller drawings. It has a very high error rate and requires much much more manual review. Zooniverse staff are working on some solutions (including improving that aggregation package and devising other ways to capture this kind of tabular data). Thanks for your understanding!

This is my first one. Regarding the ""date,"" it does not conform to the expected format rather is more general, ""Spring 73"".

So for the beg/end dates, I simply entered the year and then typed out ""Spring 73"" in the last field.

Is this as expected, or should I have entered something different?

4400,3323405,Project Announcements + Updates,"We want to give all our volunteers an update on what will be coming ""downstream"" with Angling for Data on Michigan Fishes. While it may look like we're nearing the end of two big workflows, the project is far from over! We've scanned approximately 70,000 records that cover more than 20 different kinds of card types from the IFR archives. Some of these cards you've already seen (such as the Fish Growth Analysis, Lake Summary, and Fish Classification cards) and many more that you haven't, including records of aquatic vegetation, limnology (the study of the biological, chemical, and physical features of lakes and other bodies of freshwater), plankton proliferation, and more. Some of these cards will be added to already existing workflows (like the Basic Information workflow), while other cards will get their own Zooniverse workflows in the coming months. 

If you want some more details about how we’ve organized the cards and workflows, read on. Otherwise, know that we are grateful for your generosity in making this data much more accessible! 

=======

The Basic Information Workflow is something that every card will go through, in order to get fundamental information that's on almost every card: date(s), geographic information in the form of township/range/section, and the person who collected/observed the information on the card. As of June 2021, we are only having volunteers work on Fish Growth Analysis and Fish Summary cards because we need that information before moving on to both research analysis and additional Zooniverse workflows that depend on that information. For instance, once we get this basic information for the Fish Growth Analysis cards, we can then combine that with the information volunteers transcribed from Bluegill and Yellow Perch workflows, allowing us to do more sophisticated and detailed analysis of change over time and geography. We'll also be adding a few more Fish Growth Analysis workflows for individual species that we've identified as research priorities. 

In the next few months, we'll have a new workflow for additional important information from Lake Summary cards, but we needed the data from the Basic Information workflow to create more streamlined tasks, as the placement of that additional information on the card varies greatly over the decades.

In addition to this Summary Card workflow, we’ll create new workflows for different kinds of cards, as well as additional kinds of cards going into the Basic Information workflow. Keep an eye out for these, and we’ll also make an announcement on this Talk board when they’re ready for classification. 

Thank you for all of your generous help so far and please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have questions about what's coming next in the project!

4400,3348112,Project Announcements + Updates,"We're excited to announce three new workflows, and the return of another to Angling for Data on Michigan Fishes! 

**Limnology**
The information on Limnology cards help us understand the effects of water quality and health on specific kinds of fish living in lakes, as well as how both lakes and fish living within those lakes have changed and adapted over time. Be warned: there are a lot fields left blank, but there still is valuable information in the fields that are filled in!

**Lake Summary - Older Cards**
While you've seen the Lake Summary cards before, in the Summary Card - Fish Choices workflow (where you helped identify species in the four categories of Game, Forage, Coarse, and Obnoxious), we now ask you to help transcribe more detailed text fields about the lake, including dimensions within the lake (temperature, alkalinity, etc) as well as developments around the lake (dams, houses, hotels, and more). The Lake Summary cards changed over time (from the 1930s to the 1990s), and unfortunately there are not consistently shared fields across them, so we've created a separate workflow (see below) that has fields from newer cards. These cards are pretty dense with text, but we've pointed out what lines these fields can be found on to help you find the value to transcribe. 

**Lake Summary - Newer Cards**
These newer cards have different fields, so we've created a separate workflow. Like the other Lake Summary workflow, we've pointed out what lines these fields can be found on to help you find the value to transcribe. 

Once we complete both of the Lake Summary workflows, we'll be able to combine that with the Fish Choices workflow and the data you helped transcribe through the **Basic Information Workflow** to create a much fuller picture of the history of Michigan's lakes. 

Speaking of the Basic Information Workflow, we've added the Limnology cards to this workflow to gather the date, T/R/S, and collector information for the cards. We'll then combine that data with your transcriptions from the ""Limnology"" workflow discussed above. 

If you have questions or comments about any of the new workflows, or the project as a whole, let us know, and thank so much for generously contributing your time and knowledge to making this data more accessible!",2050846,1484814,New workflows posted!,,A place for the project team to share announcements and updates about the project,,jmschell,2021-06-29T20:03:54.902Z

Therefore if my understanding is correct if we have a style guide, which not everybody will necessarily look at, then the number of inconsistency's could increase, if you suddenly say, for example, that ""pm"" should be input as ""p.m."" or ""ft"" as ""feet"" 

Having said that I know there are times when certain pieces of information can be input differently. Again for example on one of the recent new uploads within this project you have said the degree symbol can be replaced with an Asterix.

4026,3351580,Overall project questions and feedback,"So, this is a tricky edge case because of a few different things. Normally, yes, we want things to be transcribed exactly as they are, but given that this is a more controlled vocabulary task (albeit it with two numbers representing the same value), I can see the benefit of having people type the arabic instead of roman numeral, especially because of the way the Dropdown menu task works. 

Currently, the task functions so that it only searches from the **left side** of the option, rather than the entire string. So, entering the roman numeral ""I"" brings up a bunch of different possibly values (I, II, III, etc), whereas if it was switched to 1, 2, 3, etc, it'd bring up fewer choices (and depending on the number, only one choice). 

Before we'd go and make the reversal in an upcoming workflow (sneak peek, it'll be for Walleye), I want to reach out to Zooniverse HQ and make sure that there's not a way for the the Dropdown menu to  search the entire string; in other words, where typing in ""3"" would bring up III / 3 (as opposed to nothing at all, which it currently does). The reversal to 3 / III instead of III / 3 wouldn't be needed if that change is possible. If it can't be changed without a lot of effort/time, we can think through the benefits and drawbacks of the change a bit more. 

As I mentioned in the thread above, differences between values like AM, a.m., am, and other variations can easily be cleaned afterwards (we use a program called OpenRefine that clusters similar-looking values together and we can bulk-transform them in a few seconds), so those aren't as big of a deal and I wouldn't want to cause volunteers to have to ""make sure they're doing it right"". So, trying to balance a few different things here in the project design! Please let me know what you think and I'll update the thread when I hear back from Zooniverse.

I just entered it again and make the same comment.  However, the bigger question is am I repeating the same cards I did yesterday.  Shortly after I did this card yesterday I began getting ""finished"" cards, so switched to Limnology, or thought I did.  This morning when I signed in I was surprised but happy to get more Perch cards but now am wondering if the cards I am seeing really need to be done or if I am stuck in some kind of a loop.

4025,3358037,Notes,"The back of the card shows that #27 comments continue on back of the card.

There was enough info on the front of the card for 27, but when these items have continuations on the back of the card I continue them.  It just wasn't clear where 27 continued in that sentence.  I was tempted to type everything in that comment, but only that phrase was about the maximum depth.

I usually type the continuations on backs of card before I type the starts of comments on the fronts on other projects, but they way this project is set up it deletes them before you can page-forward to them after paging-back from them.  I had to retype the continuation after I typed it initially.  It's strange, on another project I'm working on I can type stuff on the fifth screen of entry and go back to the first screen and make corrections and the stuff on the fifth screen of entry is still there when I return to it.  For some reason that doesn't happen on this project.  On this project you have to check for continuations before you click to the next page of classifying the next five items or the next three items.  I have to remember that.

4025,3358131,Notes,"Hi @Xabi706920, whether the entries remain as one goes back and forth is a choice of those that set up the project - as you note.  In some projects, it makes sense when there is the potential for multiple entry lines and each should be finished before the next one starts as they use the same screens each time through.  In others it is just a choice and I think the default may be to delete/lose information on the current screen as is done here.  I actually haven't participated in all the workflows here, so there may be a good reason for the choice.  I know in the Basic Card Information that I did do a fair bit of work in that it wouldn't have mattered to leave the data intact but I don't recall having to go back because continuation lines weren't an issue as they have become with some of the recent workflows.

4026,3363306,Overall project questions and feedback,"Sorry for the slow reply to this thread, I was talking things over with the research team and waiting for a response back from Zooniverse about the functionality of the dropdown menu task. Unfortunately, it can't be changed to search the whole string rather than just the left side and since the majority of the cards I've seen have the Roman numeral rather than the Arabic numeral for the Age Group field, I'm going to leave the workflow the way it is when we put up the Walleye workflow. I'm sorry this is going to make a bit more work for you, @Xabi706920! 

As for the Field Guide, we're compiling the different things that people have said in the Talk boards, as well as a few things for workflows that are ongoing, to create a style guide, keeping in mind the point that @brookerjarvis made above that not everyone will read/follow it. However, y'all complete the workflows so fast, sometimes we can't keep up with the changes (pun intended)!

These are part of five priority species identified by the research team that the data in these cards could help shed light on in terms of change over time.
